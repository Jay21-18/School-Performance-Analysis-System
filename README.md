# School-Performance-Analysis-System
The School Performance Analysis System is designed to manage and analyze student performance in key subjects: Math, Science, and English. This system allows educators to track student grades, calculate averages, identify top performers, and determine which students may need additional support.
This is my first time making a program lie this so it's pretty basic. Feel free to make your changes to suit your preferences.
